Hello, I'm Srshti! Welcome to my little corner of the Internet. I am currently a PhD student at the STOR-i (Statistics and Operational Research with Industry) Centre for Doctoral Training, based at Lancaster University. My research sits at the interface of computational statistics and machine learning, with a focus in scalable Monte Carlo methods. 

My goal is to blog about my research, data science-y projects and other statistical topics that interest me. Please follow along, if you are so inclined.
