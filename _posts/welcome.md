Welcome to my personal website! I am a final year PhD student at the [STOR-i Centre for Doctoral Training.](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/stor-i/) My project is supervised by [Dr. Chris Nemeth](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/~nemeth/) (Lancaster) and [Professor Paul Fearnhead](https://maths.lancs.ac.uk/~fearnhea/) (Lancaster). My PhD seeks to develop new methodology for scalable Bayesian inference. 

Alongside my PhD, I sit on the [RSS Lancashire and East Cumbria](https://rss.org.uk/membership/rss-groups-and-committees/groups/lancashire-east-cumbria/) local group committee. I also served as the local group Secretary between October 2019 and September 2020. Between July and November 2020, I undertook a five-month research residency at [Cervest](https://www.cervest.earth/) within the science team. 

In my spare time, I volunteer as a Trustee for the [North Lancashire Counselling Service,](http://www.northlancscounselling.org.uk/) read extensively and participate occasionally in fitness-related activities.
