I am a final year PhD student at the [STOR-i Centre for Doctoral Training](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/stor-i/) at Lancaster University. My project is supervised by [Dr. Chris Nemeth](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/~nemeth/) and [Professor Paul Fearnhead](https://maths.lancs.ac.uk/~fearnhea/). My PhD seeks to develop new methodology for scalable Bayesian inference. 

In my spare time, I volunteer as a Trustee for the [North Lancashire Counselling Service,](http://www.northlancscounselling.org.uk/) read extensively and participate occasionally in fitness-related activities.
